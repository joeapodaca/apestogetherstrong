## Overview
Essentially, we have collated COVID data (hospitalizations/infections per day) and Equities data for the last few months of 2020.
Our chief question is: are Closing prices for equities impacted by COVID statistics?

Primarily, we are communicating by Slack and sharing data via Github.  For files too large to commit, we have been sharing in GoogleDrive.

Our initial database is created via pandas.

# Datasets

We used officially published CDC data and a precurated Kaggle dataset of equities prices for Aug-Dec of 2020.

Cleaned dataset = cleaned_close.zip.
